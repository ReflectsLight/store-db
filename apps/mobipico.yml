description: This is a (fully unofficial, of course) port of PICO-8 fantasy console Web player/emulator, currently using the 0.2.4 engine version from the official website. It supports both plain .p8 and .p8.png cart file loading (single carts only). Since the official PICO-8 engine itself is closed-source and obfuscated, there can't be any guarantee about full compatibility or sufficient performance on any KaiOS phone model.
